\usage{
unname_osmdata_sf(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An 'osmdata_sf' object returned from function of same name}
}
\value{
Same object, yet with no row names on geometry objects.
}
\description{
Remove names from 'osmdata\verb{geometry objects, for cases in which these cause issues, particularly with plotting, such as \url{https://github.com/rstudio/leaflet/issues/631}, or \url{https://github.com/r-spatial/sf/issues/1177}. Note that removing these names also removes any ability to inter-relate the different components of an}osmdata` object, so use of this function is only recommended to resolve
issues such as those linked to above.
